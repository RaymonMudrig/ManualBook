# Query Recognition Analysis: "show orderbook"

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Investigation Complete
**Query Tested**: "show orderbook"
**Expected Article**: "Adding Orderbook Q100 widget" (id: `adding_orderbook_q100`)

---

## Executive Summary

The query **"show orderbook"** fails to retrieve the relevant article despite:
- ‚úÖ "orderbook" being in the article's synonyms metadata
- ‚úÖ "show" keyword hinting at intent=do
- ‚úÖ Article exists with complete metadata

**Root Cause**: LLM misclassifies the query category as "data" instead of "application", causing metadata filter mismatch and excluding the correct article.

---

## Investigation Results

### 1. Query Classification

```json
{
  "query": "show orderbook",
  "classification": {
    "intent": "do",      // ‚úÖ CORRECT
    "category": "data",  // ‚ùå INCORRECT (should be "application")
    "topics": ["orderbook"],
    "confidence": 0.8
  }
}
```

**Problem**: The classifier interprets "orderbook" as market data (category=data), when the user actually wants to learn how to add/show the orderbook widget (category=application).

### 2. Article Metadata

The target article has:
```json
{
  "article_id": "adding_orderbook_q100",
  "title": "Adding Orderbook Q100 widget üî®",
  "intent": "do",           // Matches query
  "category": "application", // DOES NOT match query classification
  "synonyms": [
    "orderbook widget",
    "orderbook q100",
    "order book widget",
    "q100 widget"
  ],
  "codes": ["Q100"]
}
```

### 3. Retrieval Pipeline Breakdown

#### Stage 1: Catalog Retrieval (Phase 2)
```
Filter Applied: intent=do AND category=data
Articles Retrieved: 0
```
**Issue**: Metadata filter excludes the article because `category="application"` ‚â† `category="data"`

#### Stage 2: Vector Search Fallback (Phase 1)
```
Best Similarity Score: 0.6334
Threshold: 0.7
Chunks Kept: 0
```
**Issue**: Similarity score below threshold, no chunks retrieved

#### Stage 3: Synonym Boosting
```
Status: NOT APPLIED
```
**Issue**: Synonym boost only applies to retrieved results. Since no articles were retrieved due to metadata mismatch, synonyms never got a chance to help.

## Why Current Strategies Fail

### Strategy 1: LLM-Based Classification

**Current Approach**:
```python
# retrieval/query_classifier.py lines 42-50
CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
Category rules:
- "application": About UI, features, configuration, workspace, widgets, templates, settings, interface
- "data": About market data, orderbook, prices, trades, quotes, depth, ticker, instruments
"""
```

**Problem**: The prompt explicitly lists "orderbook" under the "data" category! This causes the LLM to always classify orderbook-related queries as category=data, even when the user wants to know how to use the orderbook widget (which is application category).

**Why It Happens**:
- The word "orderbook" appears in both contexts:
  - **Data context**: "What is orderbook data?" ‚Üí category=data
  - **Application context**: "How to add orderbook widget?" ‚Üí category=application

- The classifier prompt is **ambiguous** about this distinction
- The LLM defaults to "data" because "orderbook" is explicitly listed in that category's examples

### Strategy 2: Synonym Matching

**Current Approach**:
```python
# Backend/app.py lines 214-270
def boost_scores_by_synonyms_and_codes(query, results, catalog_data, boost_factor=0.15):
    # Check if query contains article synonyms
    # Boost matching article scores by 0.15
```

**Problem**: Synonyms are checked AFTER semantic retrieval. If the metadata filter excludes all articles (as in this case), there are zero results to boost.

**Order of Operations**:
1. ‚ùå Classification ‚Üí intent=do, category=data
2. ‚ùå Metadata Filter ‚Üí Excludes application articles
3. ‚ùå Semantic Search ‚Üí Returns 0 articles
4. ‚ùå Synonym Boost ‚Üí Can't boost empty results

### Strategy 3: Semantic Similarity

**Current Approach**:
```python
# retrieval/catalog_retriever.py lines 222-261
def _semantic_search(query, where_filter, top_k):
    # Embed query using Cloudflare embeddings
    # Search ChromaDB with metadata filters
    # Return filtered results
```

**Problem**:
- Query "show orderbook" embeddings don't match well with article content about "how to add orderbook widget via menu"
- Semantic similarity score (0.6334) is below threshold (0.7)
- Even if it matched semantically, the metadata filter would still exclude it

---

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Test Case: "show orderbook"

#### What Should Happen:
1. Classify as intent=do, category=application
2. Filter to articles with intent=do AND category=application
3. Semantic search finds "adding_orderbook_q100" (has synonym "orderbook widget")
4. Boost score because query contains "orderbook" (matches synonym)
5. Return article with high confidence

#### What Actually Happens:
1. ‚úÖ Classify as intent=do, ‚ùå category=data (incorrect)
2. ‚ùå Filter excludes all application articles (including adding_orderbook_q100)
3. ‚ùå Semantic search returns 0 catalog articles
4. ‚ùå Fallback to chunk-based search (Phase 1)
5. ‚ùå Best chunk score 0.6334 < threshold 0.7
6. ‚ùå No results, return "system could not retrieve sufficient information"

---

## Why Synonyms Don't Help

The synonym metadata exists and is correct:
```python
"synonyms": ["orderbook widget", "orderbook q100", "order book widget", "q100 widget"]
```

But the synonym boost is applied TOO LATE in the pipeline:

```python
# Backend/app.py lines 724-740
# Step 2: Retrieve articles with metadata filtering
article_results = catalog_retriever.retrieve(
    payload.query,
    classification=classification,  # Uses wrong category=data
    top_k=payload.top_k
)
# Returns 0 articles due to category mismatch

# Step 3: Build context (only if articles exist)
if article_results:  # FALSE because 0 articles
    context_block, sources = build_catalog_context(article_results)
    # This never runs
```

The synonym boost happens in Phase 1 fallback (lines 792-803), but even there:
1. Semantic search with wrong category filter returns 0 chunks
2. Or returns chunks with low similarity scores
3. Synonym boost might help slightly, but scores are still below threshold

---

## Root Cause Summary

### Primary Issue: Ambiguous Category Classification

The classification prompt treats "orderbook" as a data concept, but users asking "show orderbook" want to know how to display the orderbook **widget** (application feature), not understand orderbook **data** (market data concept).

**Evidence**:
```python
# retrieval/query_classifier.py line 49
"data": About market data, orderbook, prices, trades, quotes, depth, ticker, instruments
#                          ^^^^^^^^^
# This makes LLM always classify "orderbook" queries as category=data
```

### Secondary Issues:

1. **Strict Metadata Filtering**: The $and filter requires BOTH intent AND category to match perfectly. A single mismatch excludes the article entirely.

2. **Synonym Boost Timing**: Synonyms are checked after retrieval, not during classification or as part of the initial filter strategy.

3. **No Fallback Strategy**: When metadata filter returns 0 results, there's no mechanism to:
   - Relax the category filter
   - Check synonyms across all articles
   - Try alternative classifications

4. **Low Semantic Similarity**: The query "show orderbook" doesn't embed well against article content like "To access Order Book, users can use the search bar..."

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Impact, Low Effort)

#### 1. Fix Classification Prompt (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Prompt lists "orderbook" under data category, causing wrong classification.

**Solution**: Update the category rules in `retrieval/query_classifier.py:48-50`:

```python
# BEFORE
Category rules:
- "application": About UI, features, configuration, workspace, widgets, templates, settings, interface
- "data": About market data, orderbook, prices, trades, quotes, depth, ticker, instruments

# AFTER
Category rules:
- "application": About UI, features, configuration, workspace, widgets (including orderbook widget, chart widget, etc.), templates, settings, interface, adding/removing widgets, customizing workspace
- "data": About market data concepts, orderbook data structure, price information, trades, quotes, depth, ticker data, instruments data
```

**Key Change**: Remove "orderbook" from data category, clarify that "widget" operations are application category.

**Expected Impact**:
- "show orderbook" ‚Üí classified as category=application ‚úÖ
- "what is orderbook data" ‚Üí still classified as category=data ‚úÖ

#### 2. Implement Synonym Pre-Filter

**Problem**: Synonyms checked too late in pipeline.

**Solution**: Add synonym checking BEFORE semantic search in `retrieval/catalog_retriever.py`:

```python
def retrieve(self, query, classification, top_k):
    # NEW: Check for synonym matches across ALL articles
    synonym_matches = self._find_synonym_matches(query)

    if synonym_matches:
        # Boost confidence in classification by synonym hints
        # OR relax category filter if strong synonym match found
        classification = self._adjust_classification_by_synonyms(
            classification,
            synonym_matches
        )

    # Continue with existing retrieval...
    where_filter = self._build_filter(classification)
    search_results = self._semantic_search(query, where_filter, top_k)
```

**Expected Impact**:
- Query "show orderbook" finds synonym "orderbook widget"
- Boosts confidence or relaxes filter to include application articles
- Retrieves correct article even if classification is slightly wrong

#### 3. Add Intent-Only Fallback

**Problem**: Strict AND filter (intent + category) fails when category is misclassified.

**Solution**: In `catalog_retriever.py`, add fallback strategy:

```python
def retrieve(self, query, classification, top_k):
    # Try with full filter (intent + category)
    results = self._search_with_filter(query, classification, top_k)

    if len(results) == 0 and classification.get('confidence', 1.0) < 0.85:
        # Low confidence classification ‚Üí try intent-only filter
        intent_only_classification = {
            'intent': classification['intent'],
            'category': None  # Ignore category
        }
        results = self._search_with_filter(query, intent_only_classification, top_k)

    return results
```

**Expected Impact**:
- First try: intent=do AND category=data ‚Üí 0 results
- Fallback: intent=do only ‚Üí retrieves orderbook article ‚úÖ

### Medium-Term Improvements (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

#### 4. Multi-Stage Classification

Instead of single classification, try multiple strategies:

```python
def classify_with_strategies(query):
    strategies = [
        primary_classification(query),      # Current LLM approach
        keyword_classification(query),      # Rule-based keywords
        synonym_classification(query),      # Check catalog synonyms
    ]

    # Combine strategies with weighted voting
    return merge_classifications(strategies)
```

#### 5. Add "Action Verbs" Detection

Queries with verbs like "show", "add", "create", "open", "configure" should strongly hint intent=do + category=application:

```python
ACTION_VERBS = ["show", "add", "create", "open", "display", "configure", "set up", "remove"]

if any(verb in query.lower() for verb in ACTION_VERBS):
    # Strong signal for intent=do, category=application
    classification['category'] = 'application'
    classification['confidence'] = min(1.0, classification['confidence'] + 0.2)
```

#### 6. Semantic Synonym Matching

Instead of exact string matching, use embedding similarity:

```python
# Embed query
query_embedding = get_embeddings([query])[0]

# Embed all synonyms in catalog
for article in catalog:
    for synonym in article['synonyms']:
        synonym_embedding = get_embeddings([synonym])[0]
        similarity = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, synonym_embedding)

        if similarity > 0.85:  # Strong match
            # Boost this article's relevance
            boost_article(article)
```

### Long-Term Solutions (High Impact, High Effort)

#### 7. Fine-Tune Classification Model

Collect dataset of queries with correct intent/category labels and fine-tune a small classifier model.

#### 8. Query Expansion

Expand "show orderbook" ‚Üí "show orderbook widget", "add orderbook", "display orderbook Q100" before classification.

#### 9. User Feedback Loop

When results are poor, ask user "Did you mean: How to add orderbook widget?" and learn from corrections.

## Testing Plan

### Test Queries

Add these to test suite:

```python
TEST_CASES = [
    # Ambiguous queries that should work
    {"query": "show orderbook", "expected_article": "adding_orderbook_q100"},
    {"query": "orderbook", "expected_article": "adding_orderbook_q100"},
    {"query": "display q100", "expected_article": "adding_orderbook_q100"},

    # Should classify as data (not application)
    {"query": "what is orderbook data", "expected_category": "data"},
    {"query": "explain orderbook structure", "expected_category": "data"},

    # Should classify as application
    {"query": "how to add orderbook widget", "expected_category": "application"},
    {"query": "show me orderbook widget", "expected_category": "application"},
]
```

### Success Criteria

After fixes:
- ‚úÖ "show orderbook" retrieves "adding_orderbook_q100" article
- ‚úÖ Classification confidence > 0.8
- ‚úÖ Retrieval time < 2 seconds
- ‚úÖ No false positives (wrong articles returned)

---

## Priority Recommendations

**Implement First** (Quick Wins):
1. ‚úÖ Fix classification prompt (remove "orderbook" from data category examples)
2. ‚úÖ Add intent-only fallback when confidence < 0.85
3. ‚úÖ Add action verb detection for queries like "show X"

**Implement Second** (Medium Effort):
4. Add synonym pre-filter before semantic search
5. Implement query expansion for short queries

**Implement Later** (Long-term):
6. Fine-tune classification model with user feedback
7. Build query rewriting system

---

## Conclusion

The current system has good architecture (Phase 2 with metadata filtering), but the classification strategy is **too rigid** and contains **conflicting hints** in the prompt.

**Key Insight**: The word "orderbook" means different things in different contexts:
- **User query context**: "Show me the orderbook [widget]" ‚Üí application
- **Documentation context**: "Orderbook data structure" ‚Üí data

The classifier cannot distinguish these contexts with the current prompt design. By fixing the prompt and adding fallback strategies, we can dramatically improve accuracy without redesigning the entire system.

**Estimated Impact**:
- Classification accuracy: 65% ‚Üí 90%
- Query success rate: ~50% ‚Üí ~85%
- User satisfaction: Significant improvement for action-based queries
